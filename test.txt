All I have is a voice,
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain,
Of the sensual man-in-the-street,
And the lie of authority,
Whose buildings grope the sky. 
There is no such thing as the state,
And no one exists alone. 
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or police,
We must love one another or die.
